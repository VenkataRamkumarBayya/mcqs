The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature.
Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature.
If kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire.
Ignition temperature of kerosene oil is lower than that of wood.
Inflammable substances are petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) etc.
For fires involving electrical equipment and inflammable materials like petrol, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best extinguisher.
Carbon dioxide can be stored at high pressure as a liquid in cylinders.
When released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down.
The substances which vapourise during burning, give flames.
Charcoal, on the other hand, does not vapourise and so does not produce a flame.
Fuels are mainly wood, charcoal, petrol, kerosene etc.
A good fuel is one which is readily available, cheap, burns easily in air at a moderate rate, and produces a large amount of heat.
The complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is called its calorific value.
The calorific value of a fuel is expressed in a unit called kilojoule per kg (kJ/kg).
Combustion of most fuels releases carbon dioxide in the environment.
Increased concentration of carbon dioxide leads to global warming.
Burning of wood gives a lot of smoke which is very harmful for our health.
Oxides of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in rain water and form acids, resulting in acid rain.
In automobiles, petrol is being replaced by CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because CNG is a cleaner fuel.
