Lightning is also an electric spark.
Lightning is caused by the accumulation of charges in the clouds.
The ancient Greeks knew as early as 600 B.C. that when amber was rubbed with fur, it attracted light objects such as hair.
During the development of a thunderstorm, the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward.
The process of electric discharge can occur between two or more clouds, or between clouds and the earth.
Lightning Conductor is a device used to protect buildings from the effect of lightning.
A metallic rod, taller than the building, is installed in the walls of the building during its construction.
The rod provides easy route for the transfer of electric charge to the ground.
The earth is not in one piece, it is fragmented into plates.
Most earthquakes are caused by the movement of earthâ€™s plates.
Tremors on the earth can also be caused when a volcano erupts, or a meteor hits the earth, or an underground nuclear explosion is carried out.
The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth, these are called seismic waves.
The waves are recorded by an instrument called the seismograph.
An earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4.
Modern building technology can make it possible to design buildings that can withstand major tremors.
