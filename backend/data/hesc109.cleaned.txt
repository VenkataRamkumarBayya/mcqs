Friction always opposes the applied force.
The force of friction acts between the surface of the floor, or on a table.
Friction is caused by the interlocking of irregularities in the two surfaces.
Friction at the instant an object starts moving is slightly smaller than the static friction.
Friction is desirable in some situations.
Friction can be increased by making a surface rough.
Friction can be reduced by using lubricants.
Rolling reduces friction.
Air exerts frictional force on objects moving through it.
Water and other liquids exert force of friction when objects move through them.
Friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact.
For a given pair of surfaces, friction depends on how hard the two surfaces press against each other.
Static friction comes into play when we try to move an object at rest.
Sliding friction comes into play when an object is sliding over another.
Sliding friction is smaller than static friction.
Friction is important for many of our activities.
The sole of the shoes and the tyres of the vehicle are treaded to increase friction.
Friction is sometimes undesirable.
When one body rolls over another body, rolling friction comes into play.
In many machines, friction is reduced by using ball bearings.
Fluid friction can be minimized by giving suitable shapes to bodies moving in fluids.
