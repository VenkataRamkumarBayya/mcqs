Plastic and wood do not conduct electricity.
Materials, which do not allow electric current to pass through them easily, are poor conductors of electricity.
Aluminium conducts electricity.
Some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors.
Most materials can conduct electricity under certain conditions.
When salt is dissolved in distilled water, we obtain salt solution, which is a conductor of electricity.
The water that we get from sources such as taps, hand pumps, wells and ponds is a good conductor of electricity because it contains several salts dissolved in it.
Distilled water is free of salts and is a poor conductor of electricity.
The passage of an electric current through a conducting liquid causes chemical reactions.
Most liquids that conduct electricity are solutions of acids, bases and salts.
A metal can have a coating of another metal.
When electric current is passed through the copper sulphate solution, copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate.
The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called electroplating.
Objects can be made from a cheaper metal and then coated with a layer of a different, more expensive metal.
Iron tends to corrode and rust, so a coating of zinc is deposited on iron to protect it.
Chromium is expensive and it does not corrode or easily get scratched, so it is often used as a coating on cheaper metals.
In electroplating factories, the disposal of the used conducting solution is a major environmental concern.
