A moving object like a ball rolling on the ground slows down. 
In science, a push or a pull on an object is called a force. 
The strength of a force is usually expressed by its magnitude. 
The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as the muscular force. 
Muscular force can be applied only when it is in contact with an object, it is also called a contact force. 
The force of friction between the surface of the ball and the ground brings the moving ball to rest. 
The force exerted by a magnet is an example of a non-contact force. 
The force exerted by a magnet on a piece of iron is also a non-contact force. 
The force exerted by a charged body is also a non-contact force.
