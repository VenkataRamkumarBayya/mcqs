Sound plays an important role in our lives, helping us to communicate with one another.
Sound is produced by vibrating objects.
In human beings, the vibration of the vocal cords produces sound.
Sound travels through a medium such as gas, liquid or solid.
The eardrum senses the vibrations of sound and sends the signals to the brain.
The number of oscillations or vibrations per second is called the frequency of oscillation.
Frequency is expressed in hertz (Hz).
Larger the amplitude of vibration, the louder is the sound.
Higher the frequency of vibration, the higher is the pitch, and shriller is the sound.
Sound cannot travel through a vacuum.
Sound can travel through wood, metal, and other solids.
Sound can also travel through strings.
The eardrum is like a stretched rubber sheet and sound vibrations make it vibrate.
The voice of a woman usually has a higher frequency than that of a man.
Sounds of frequencies less than about 20 vibrations per second are not audible to the human ear.
Sounds of frequencies higher than about 20,000 vibrations per second are also not audible to the human ear.
Dogs can hear sounds of frequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.
Noise pollution can cause high blood pressure, anxiety and other health disorders.
Exposure to loud sound continuously may cause temporary or even permanent impairment of hearing.
Silencing devices must be installed in air craft engines, transport vehicles, and industrial machines to control noise.
Noise producing industries should be set up away from residential areas.
Television and music systems should be run at low volumes to minimize noise pollution.
