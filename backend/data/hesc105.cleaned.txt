Some natural causes of deforestation are forest fires and severe droughts.
Deforestation disturbs the balance in the earth.
Trees in the forest are cut for procuring land for cultivation, building houses and factories, and making furniture or using wood as fuel.
Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall.
Deforestation is a major cause which disturbs the water cycle.
Physical properties of the soil get affected by plantation and vegetation.
Fewer trees result in more soil erosion.
Removal of the top layer of the soil makes it less fertile.
Gradually the fertile land gets converted into deserts.
Animal life is also affected by deforestation.
Wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, biosphere reserves etc., are used for conservation of biodiversity.
Biodiversity refers to the variety of organisms existing on the earth, their interrelationships and their relationship with the environment.
Endemic species are those species of plants and animals which are found exclusively in a particular area.
Wildlife Sanctuaries like reserve forests provide protection and suitable living conditions to wild animals.
People living in wildlife sanctuaries are allowed to do certain activities such as grazing by their livestock, collecting medicinal plants, firewood, etc.
Animals whose numbers are diminishing to a level that they might face extinction are known as the endangered animals.
Red Data Book is the source book which keeps a record of all the endangered animals and plants.
Paper can be recycled five to seven times for use.
The answer to deforestation is reforestation.
Reforestation involves restocking of the destroyed forests by planting new trees.
If the deforested area is left undisturbed, it re-establishes itself.
